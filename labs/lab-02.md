## Exercise 1: Development Environment Setup Planning (Team of 2)

**Objective:** Plan and document a development environment setup without actually installing software.

### Instructions:

1. **Project Scenario Assignment:** Choose one development scenario:
   - Building a simple website - Build a simple business website with text, images, and contact forms
   - Creating a mobile app - Create a basic smartphone app for ordering food
   - Developing a desktop application - Develop a simple calculator program for Windows/Mac
   - Building a data analysis project - Analyze sales data and create charts and reports

2. **Environment Planning:** Research and plan:
   - Which type of IDE would be most suitable
   - What additional tools would be needed
   - Hardware requirements
   - Team collaboration needs
   - Estimated setup time and complexity

3. **Setup Guide Creation :** Write step-by-step setup checklist


### Deliverable:
Complete development environment setup plan with tool justifications and installation checklist.

# Lab 2 Rubric - Software Development Environment Setup Planning

**Total Points: 2 marks**

## Requirements for Completion:
* **Team Formation:** Work in teams of 2 students
* **Scenario Selection:** Choose one of the four provided development scenarios
* **Complete Planning:** Address all required planning components (IDE selection, tools, hardware, collaboration, timing)
* **Setup Guide:** Create detailed step-by-step installation checklist
* **Documentation:** Provide clear justifications for all tool choices

## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 mark | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Missing scenario selection OR environment planning incomplete OR no setup guide created OR justifications missing/inadequate | Selected scenario and completed most planning components, but setup guide lacks detail OR tool justifications are superficial OR missing 1-2 key planning elements | Successfully completed all components: scenario selected, comprehensive environment planning addressing all 5 areas, detailed setup checklist, and well-reasoned tool justifications |

## Detailed Expectations:

### For 2 marks (Good), teams must demonstrate:
- **Complete Scenario Analysis:** Clear understanding of chosen development scenario and its specific requirements
- **Comprehensive Planning:** Thorough consideration of all 5 planning areas:
  - IDE selection with specific recommendations
  - Additional tools identification and rationale
  - Hardware requirements assessment
  - Team collaboration strategy
  - Realistic time and complexity estimates
- **Detailed Setup Guide:** Step-by-step checklist that another team could follow
- **Strong Justifications:** Clear reasoning for each tool choice based on project needs
- **Professional Documentation:** Well-organized, clear presentation of all components

### For 1 mark (Fair), teams show:
- **Basic Completion:** Most planning components addressed but with limited depth
- **Adequate Documentation:** Setup guide present but missing important details
- **Weak Justifications:** Tool choices made but reasoning is unclear or superficial
- **Missing Elements:** 1-2 planning areas not properly addressed

### For 0 marks (Poor), teams have:
- **Incomplete Work:** Major components missing or inadequately addressed
- **No Clear Planning:** Scenario chosen but no meaningful environment planning
- **Missing Documentation:** No setup guide or justifications provided
- **No Demonstration of Understanding:** Shows no grasp of development environment concepts

## Teamwork Expectation:
Both team members must contribute meaningfully to the planning and documentation process. The deliverable should reflect collaborative effort and shared understanding of the development environment requirements.
