# Computer Systems In-Class Lab Exercises

## Exercise 1: System Hardware Detective (15-20 minutes)
**Format:** Solo or pairs  
**Objective:** Students will identify and analyze their computer's hardware components using built-in system tools.

### Instructions:
1. **Windows Users:** Open "System Information" (type `msinfo32` in Start menu)
   **Mac Users:** Hold Option key + Apple menu â†’ "System Information"
   **Linux Users:** Open terminal and run `lscpu`, `lshw`, or `inxi -F`

2. **Find and record the following:**
   - Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores
   - Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5)
   - Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity
   - Operating System version

3. **Analysis Questions:**
   - Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?
   - Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?
   - How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

### Deliverable:
Complete a simple system specification sheet and answer the analysis questions.

## Exercise 2: Operating System Feature Hunt (15-20 minutes)
**Format:** Solo or pairs  
**Objective:** Students will explore and identify key OS functions on their own devices.

### Mission:
Find real examples of the five key OS functions running on your computer right now.

### Tasks:

1. **Process Management:**
   - Open Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or System Monitor (Linux)
   - Identify 5 currently running processes
   - Find one process using the most CPU

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Check total RAM usage
   - Find which application is using the most memory
   - Identify available free memory

3. **File System Management:**
   - Navigate to your Documents folder
   - Create a new folder called "OS_Lab_Test"
   - Check the folder's properties/info to see creation date

4. **Device Management:**
   - Access Device Manager (Windows) or System Report (Mac)
   - Identify 3 different types of hardware devices listed
   - Find one device driver that's currently installed

5. **Security Features:**
   - Check if Windows Defender/antivirus is running
   - Verify if automatic updates are enabled
   - Look for any recent security scans

### Challenge Questions:
- Which process is using the most resources and why might that be?
- What would happen if your OS didn't manage memory automatically?
- How does your OS protect you from security threats?

### Deliverable:
Complete a checklist of found features and answer the challenge questions.

## Lab Rubric

**Total Points: 2 marks**

## Requirements for Completion:
* **Exercise 1 (Required):** Complete system specification sheet with all hardware components identified AND answer all three analysis questions with thoughtful responses
* **Exercise 2 (Optional):** If attempted, complete feature checklist for all 5 OS functions AND answer challenge questions

## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 mark | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Missing system specification data OR analysis questions not attempted OR answers lack depth (single sentence, vague responses that don't address the questions) | Successfully identified most hardware components and completed system specification sheet, but analysis questions show minimal effort or understanding | Successfully completed full system specification sheet with accurate hardware identification AND provided thoughtful analysis answers that demonstrate understanding of hardware implications |
